# Pokemon TCG Scanner - Vercel Deployment Fix

## Current Issue
Your Vercel deployment shows a 502 Bad Gateway error because Flask applications need specific configuration for serverless environments.

## Files Created for Vercel Deployment

### 1. vercel.json
- Configures Vercel to use the Python runtime
- Routes all requests to your scanner application
- Handles serverless function setup

### 2. api/index.py
- Vercel-compatible entry point for your scanner
- Imports your working scanner_with_search.py
- Preserves all 19,120+ cards and functionality

## Next Steps

1. **Push these files to your GitHub repository:**
   ```bash
   git add vercel.json api/index.py
   git commit -m "Add Vercel deployment configuration"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Redeploy on Vercel:**
   - Trigger a new deployment from your Vercel dashboard
   - Or push the changes and auto-deploy will trigger

## Expected Result
After redeployment, your scanner will load with:
- Complete Google Sheets database (19,120+ cards)
- OpenAI card recognition and analysis
- Authentication system and search functionality
- Inventory management with real-time updates
- Professional web interface

The 502 error should be resolved and your scanner will be fully functional on the live URL.
